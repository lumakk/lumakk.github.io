# About

I'm a college student taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at 
[Polytechnic University of the Philippines][PUP]. Prior to this, I completed my secondary education at
[University of the East - Caloocan][UE] under the STEM strand. I like Linux, computers
and experiencing new things.
